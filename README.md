# Seldon Data Viz Task

This project was a task during a job application for the startup Seldion. The task was to produce a visualisation for comparing 3D data before from model training versus model deployment. The main tools used were [React](https://reactjs.org/) (specifically [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/)) and [Victory](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/).
